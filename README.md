## 📘 Overview

**FitPulse** is an **AI-powered health anomaly detection system** designed to analyze data collected from fitness trackers such as heart rate, steps, and sleep duration.  
It uses **machine learning algorithms** to detect irregular health patterns and provides **interactive visual dashboards** to monitor daily trends.

The goal of FitPulse is to help users **understand their health data**, **identify anomalies early**, and **encourage proactive wellness management**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Collect and preprocess health data from wearable fitness devices.  
- Detect anomalies using **rule-based** and **machine learning** methods.  
- Visualize user activity and health trends through interactive dashboards.  
- Generate downloadable **reports (CSV/TXT)** with summarized insights.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

```
User Upload → Data Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → ML Models (Isolation Forest + KMeans)
             ↓
        Visualization → Anomaly Detection Report
```

🧩 **Modules:**
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleans, aligns, and validates timestamps.  
2. **Feature Extraction** – Uses *TSFresh* to derive statistical features.  
3. **ML Models** – Isolation Forest detects anomalies; KMeans groups user behavior.  
4. **Visualization** – Streamlit dashboard for charts and insights.  
5. **Report Generation** – Exports summarized results.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

**Algorithms Used:**
- **Isolation Forest:** Detects irregular or rare data points.  
- **KMeans Clustering:** Groups user activity into behavioral categories.  
- **TSFresh:** Automatically extracts features from time-series data.  
- **Prophet (Optional):** Models seasonality and future health trends.
